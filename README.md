# Scan Ride Project

This is a mini-project developed as part of my BE EEE coursework. It focuses on enabling secure vehicle ignition using QR code scanning and passkey verification through a mobile website interface.

## 💻 *Project Overview*

- A user scans a QR code attached to the bike using their mobile phone.
- The QR leads to a website where the user enters a *passkey*.
- If the *passkey is correct*:
  - The user is redirected to a *map page*.
  - The bike starts automatically via relay activation.
- If the *passkey is incorrect*:
  - The website displays *“Passkey Incorrect”*, and the bike remains off.
